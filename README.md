Image API

The functionality of this app is to resize an image to the specs that you desire. 

To use this project, you need the src file, a file titled "images" with images you would like to be resized, and a file titled "resized" to store your resized images.

When you are ready to use this app, go to your browser, type the local host with a port of 3000, the name of the image you would like resized, the width, and the height. An example of this URL could be: http://localhost:3000/?name=fjord&width=100&height=100.
